<p align="center"> <font face="Times New Roman" size="+2">THE CAT IN THE CASTLE, 
  Bill Solly's first musical for children, <br>
  premiered in 1974 Off Broadway in New York City at the 13th Street Theatre, 
  <br>
  where it ran for an unprecedented two years. It has since been produced in <br>
  theatres all over the country, and has been revived many times in New York, 
  <br>
  always with great success, most recently at the West Side YMCA. </font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="+2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;The story 
  concerns a couple of New York cats, Hugo and Mimi, who stowaway on an ocean 
  liner, <br>
  get &nbsp;thrown overboard, and end up in a fascinating but frightening kingdom 
  where cats are illegal. Reigning &nbsp;Queen Gloria XIV is allergic to cats 
  and exterminates them mercilessly, courtesy of her <br>
  pet &nbsp;pterodactyl who yawns flames, and whom she keeps in bondage by his 
  fear of her mysterious gatekeeper, Morahorahora. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="+2">&nbsp;&nbsp;Hugo is all 
  for catching the next boat home, but curious Mimi insists "a&nbsp;cat can look 
  at a queen" &nbsp;and smuggles herself into the castle. Disaster ensues, with 
  the Queen on the&nbsp;warpath, but an &nbsp;unexpected rapport develops between 
  Mimi and the pterodactyl whose name is&nbsp;Ptommy (he puts ps &nbsp;in front 
  of his t's). Of course Hugo has to come to the rescue, but he is &nbsp;helped 
  by -&nbsp;one of the chief &nbsp;attractions of the show - the children in the 
  audience. It is they who must &nbsp;supply the &nbsp;ultimate secret &nbsp;reason 
  "Why the Queen Hates Cats". <br>

<div align="left"><font size="+2" face="Times New Roman">Summary: </font> </div>
<p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="+2" face="Times New Roman">The tale 
  has two cats, Hugo and Mimi, invading a castle where a wicked Queen Gloria keeps 
  a pterodactyl on guard against the creatures, because she's allergic to them. 
  The plot allows for mischief making, tugs-of-war for the allegiance of the children 
  in the audience, and some sweet doses of sentiment. The choicest ingredient 
  of the play - though the entire cast of six is delightful -- is the winsome 
  Pterodactyl, Ptommy and who, at a particularly trying moment, must ask another 
  character to 'p-teach me to un-p-tie the p-tails of p-two cats'.</font></p>
