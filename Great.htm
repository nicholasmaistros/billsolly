  &nbsp;&nbsp;Among the great glories of Hollywood's film production during the 
  1940s was (and still is) its &nbsp;outporing of singing, dancing (mostly in 
  Technicolor) musicals about show biz. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of these films followed a basic plotline 
  in which a group of young theatrical hopefuls found &nbsp;itself pulled apart 
  by the ups and downs of theatrical fortune, not to mention the onset of a world 
  war, &nbsp;and often a romantic entanglement with a glamorous outsider, before 
  at last being reunited and &nbsp;reconciled in time for a happy ending at the 
  final fadeout.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sparkling world of these movies comes 
  to life again in THE GREAT AMERICAN &nbsp;BACKSTAGE MUSICAL, recreated by a 
  hard-working cast of 6 who take us from Greenwich Village &nbsp;to wartime London, 
  to the battlefields of World War II and back to New York again in one &nbsp;movie-&nbsp;length 
  act and fifteen musical numbers. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="+3">HOLLYWOOD&#133;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="+2">&quot;Los Angeles has a new smash hit, 
  THE GREAT AMERICAN BACKSTAGE MUSICAL. The book by Bill Solly and Donald Ward 
  is brilliantly done. Bill Solly's music and lyrics are fresh and biting.&quot; 
  <br>
  - Bill Edwards, DAILY VARIETY</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="+2">&quot;Solly and Ward's show does spoof 
  the old days, but it plays so affectionately that it almost seems to be sighing 
  for them. The audience goes in prepared to hoot and finds itself strangely touched. 
  This is a show with a future.&quot;<br>
  - Dan Sullivan, LOS ANGELES TIMES</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="+3">LONDON&#133;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="+2">&quot;So enjoyable it may give nostalgia 
  a good name. Music and lyrics by Bill Solly are impeccably and dottily elegant&quot; 
  - John Peters, SUNDAY TIMES</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="+2">&quot;A smart small swell little show&quot; 
  - Herbert Kretzmer, DAILY EXPRESS</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="+2">&quot;Bill Solly's songs are not only 
  beautifully imitated from 1939 music; they would have rated high in it&quot; 
  - B.A. Young, FINANCIAL TIMES</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="+2">&quot;Recreates the age of jitterbug, 
  torch song and Broadway vaudeville in a series of numbers that land right on 
  target. The lyrics are often metrically ingenious, and the music is at once 
  very knowing and bursting with exuberant innocence. There are no duds.&quot; 
  - Irving Wardle, THE TIMES<br>
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="+3">GOODSPEED&#133;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="+2">&quot;Lush tunes&#133; Bill Solly's 
  songs are never banal. Solly and Ward wisely avoid the gee whizz school of musical 
  comedy. This show not only has a heart but, more importantly, a soul.&quot; 
  - Jay Newquist, NEW HAVEN REGISTER</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="+2">&quot;Entertainment pure and simple. 
  You get involved with the characters and you are always entertained. The score 
  is not only refreshing, it is just plain wonderful.&quot; - Tim Holley, BRIDGEPORT 
  POST</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="+3">NEW YORK&#133;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="+2">&quot;Bill Solly and Donald Ward, co-authors 
  of the long-running BOY MEETS BOY, genuinely love the vintage shows they spoof, 
  and skillfully lampoon the old-fashioned formula musical. Bill Solly's songs 
  are clever enough to invite rip-roaring comic performances.&quot; - Stephen

  <p><font size="+2" face="Times New Roman">Summary: <br>
    In the late 30s, the rumbles of World War II were sounding around the world. 
    While America was recovering from the Great Depression, Europe saw the shadows 
    of Hitler and Mussolini strut across the continent. <br>
    <br>
    That era produced a particular type of movie - the backstage musical. Written 
    as show entertainment, the genre traced the trials and tribulations of countless 
    struggling writers and artists, who were elevated, virtually overnight, to 
    the dizzy heights of fame and stardom. <br>
    <br>
    These artfully simple stories were staples of Hollywood in those strife-torn 
    years. This show is an affectionate look over the shoulder to a time when 
    the world turned at a slower pace, or so it seemed, and every cloud had a 
    silver lining. This show is a delightful pastiche of the period filled with 
    melodies that remain infinitely hummable.<br>

  <p><font size="+2" face="Times New Roman"> The action opens backstage at Johnny's 
    Bar in Greenwich Village.</font></p>
