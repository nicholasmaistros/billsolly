      Jermyn Street Theatre,  London 2012</strong></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="bigbluetext1"><img src="images/boymeetsboy-londoncompany.jpg" width="600" height="448" alt="Bill with the London company of &quot;Boy Meets Boy&quot;" /></span></p>
      <p align="left" class="quotes">“A timeless classic – the best musical comedy I have seen for a long time!”<br />
      <span class="quotes-blue">Andrew Tomlins, West End Frame</span></p>
    <p class="quotes">“Say it loud, say it proud, it’s a hit!”<br />
      <span class="quotes-blue">Dominic Cavendish, The Daily Telegraph</span></p>
    <p class="quotes">“A mystery why this funny, charming, tuneful musical is not better-known. Music that channels Irving Berlin, lyrics with witty facility of Cole Porter. One of those rare ‘hidden gems’ that genuinely shines!”<br />
      <span class="quotes-blue">Bennet Catty, What’s On Stage</span></p>
    <p class="quotes">“Homage to romantic screwball screen musicals with a sharp, drolly subversive twist. Never has a rebuke to intolerance been delivered with such nonchalant light-heartedness, or a political point been made with such sweet-natured implicitness…the un-jaded freshness of the material - an unexpected Christmas treat.”<br />
      <span class="quotes-blue">Paul Taylor, The Independent</span></p>
    <p class="quotes">“Bill Solly &amp; Donald Ward create a parallel universe…its themes become universal. Some songs are almost Cole Portery. Funny, silly and, with gay marriage on the horizon, slyly topical!”<br />
      <span class="quotes-blue">Libby Purves, The Times</span></p>
    <p class="quotes">“Altogether delightful…consistently beguiling! What’s lovely in Boy Meets Boy is the total lack of fuss made by a piece that takes gay marriage in its stride – and this from a 1975 musical, no less!”<br />
      <span class="quotes-blue">Matt Wolf, International Herald Tribune</span></p>
    <p class="quotes">“Disarming as it is charming…Unexpectedly touching love ballads… buoyant wit. Deserves further exposure. Hard to beat!”<br />
      <span class="quotes-blue">David Benedict, Variety</span></p>
    <p class="quotes">“Dear Noel and Cole, it seems you have spawned some offspring. Bill Solly’s lyrics are wry, witty, set to jaunty, catchy and occasionally melancholy tunes that linger like the smell of caviar under the fingernails!”<br />
      <span class="quotes-blue">Peter Scott-Presland, Broadway Baby</span></p>
    <p class="quotes">“A winning conceit. In 1975 this lithe blasé vision of an alternative reality must have felt subversive. The surprise is that it still does. Songs are buoyant and seductive. Exactly the sort of show that filmmakers should be lining up to rescue and adapt.”<br />
      <span class="quotes-blue">Ryan Gilbey, New Statesman</span></p>
    <p class="quotes">“Sparkling musical comedy - impeccable flair. Solly’s music and witty lyrics pay affectionate homage to the likes of Porter and Berlin. There is an unfailing sense of optimism about this show that makes it one of the most pertinent revivals of the year!”<br />
      <span class="quotes-blue">Paul Vale, The Stage, &amp; Grandiloquent Exigence</span></p>
    <p class="quotes">“Delightful - a charming musical comedy, equally full of passion and laughs! Witty lines. Run deserves to be wildly successful.”<br />
      <span class="quotes-blue">The Londoneer</span></p>
    <p class="quotes">“This delightful show is 37 years old. What a treat we have been missing! Delicious story, splendid songs. A well-drilled ensemble packs the stage with more vitality than the West End has seen in ages! <br />
      <span class="quotes-blue">Michael Darvell, Classical Source</span></p>
    <p class="quotes">“This is a fine romance! Sparkling, tuneful score and sharp dialogue and lyrics. Endlessly hummable, witty and clever songs. At a time when gay marriage is high on the news agenda, it seems surreal, but also completely beguiling, that in 1975 Solly &amp; Ward should have anticipated it so delightfully.”<br />
      <span class="quotes-blue">Johnny Fox, One Stop Arts</span></p>
    <p class="quotes">“Hugely fun – catchy songs – laugh-out-loud lyrics – unashamedly heart-warming! Its frothiness is joyous!”<br />
      <span class="quotes-blue">Tom Wicker, TimeOut London</span></p>
    <p class="quotes">“Clever – great score, good book, delightful show!” <br />
      <span class="quotes-blue">Gareth Hames, Gareth’s Culture &amp; Travel Blog</span></p>
    <p class="quotes">“A long overdue London outing – charming and light-hearted romantic comedy, with catchy tunes – an entertaining and highly enjoyable experience…Feels both timeless and modern, with an array of often very funny songs. Boy Meets Boy deserves a much bigger audience.”<br />
      <span class="quotes-blue">Tracey Sinclair, Exeunt Magazine</span></p>
    <p class="quotes">“The story is simple but never trite, the music is genuinely hummable, and are there are some really funny moments – laugh-out loud funny. A real, genuine delight of a show!”<br />
      <span class="quotes-blue">UK Theatre Web</span></p>
    <p class="quotes">“Charming, fun, and thoroughly entertaining. Solly’s musical score remains excellent with devilishly witty lyrics throughout. Everyone left smiling.”<br />
      <span class="quotes-blue">Natanya Paris, Plays to See</span></p>
    <p class="quotes">“This gem of a show… funny, clever and heart-warming with some beautiful tunes and great lyrics.”<br />
      <span class="quotes-blue">Confessions of a Theatre Girl</span></p>
    <p class="quotes">“Hilariously written, a vibrant array of  witty songs and catchy tunes that audiences will love and laugh to. Definitely a must for musical lovers.&quot;<br />
      <span class="quotes-blue">ViewLondon</span><br />
      <br />
      “A totally delicious ball of delight. Fabulous pastiches of songs of the era. From the opening chorus to the glittering finale I had a grin from ear to ear and I shed a few tears at the end, but from pure joy!”<br />
      <span class="quotes-blue">Front Row Dress</span></p>
    <p class="quotes">“First produced off Broadway in the 70s and hasn’t been seen since – a crying shame, as it is very charming with pretty tunes, witty dialogue and lyrics. An evening of sheer enchantment!”		<br />
      <span class="quotes-blue">Aline Waites, Remote Goat</span><br />
    </p>
    <p class="quotes">“Delightful musical comedy –sweet, lovable and original story. Catchy music and lyrics by Bill Solly wonderfully reminiscent of the golden age of musical theatre. Joyous old-fashioned love story with a beautiful score!” <br />
       <span class="quotes-blue">Geri Silver, A Younger Theatre</span></p>
    <p class="quotes">“An unexpected gem of a musical. The score is varied in style and form, the lyrics clever, and the script highly intelligent and very funny. Both the script and lyrics have elements of Wilde’s wit and Coward’s charm. A festive treat – highly recommended!” <br />
       <span class="quotes-blue">Emma Slater, London Theatre Tickets, London….</span></p>
    <p class="quotes">“An absolute knock-out success – this is how you do romantic comedy! Biting one-liners and asides sparkle like diamonds. Bill Solly’s love songs call to mind the likes of Cole Porter and Richard Rodgers. I've rarely been prouder or happier in leaving a theatre!”<br />
      	<span class="quotes-blue">Ian Foster, The Public Reviews</span></p>
    <p class="quotes">“The laughs come thick and fast! A thoroughly entertaining watch that only leaves us thirsty for more!”<br />
      <span class="quotes-blue">Richard Taverner, The Upcoming</span></p>
    <p class="quotes">“Dazzling pastiche 1930s musical comedy…couldn’t be more fun! Good jokes, great lyrics and tunes!”<br />
      <span class="quotes-blue">Timothy Ramsden, Reviews Gate</span><br />
    </p>
    <p class="quotes">“Extravagantly lovable London delight! Many frolicsome, touching and memorable songs! A glorious tinderbox of charm that will not fail to make smile meet face.”<br />
      	<span class="quotes-blue">James Waygood, QX Magazine</span></p>
    <p class="quotes">“The USA and UK governments plus the Anglican Church should march down to see this production and maybe then the need for debate would be eliminated. The show just whizzes along! The tuneful music is yet another trimming on the icing of this delectable cake!”<br />
      <span class="quotes-blue">London Theatreviews</span></p>
    <p class="quotes">“This is a musical that restores the original meaning to gay! Delightful thirties-influenced music – a treat!” <br />
       <span class="quotes-blue">David Chadderton, British Theatre Guide</span></p>
    <p class="quotes">“Skilfully plotted by Bill Solly &amp; Donald Ward… Many numbers where ever-clever but never tricksy rhymes elicit a silent chuckle as they recall a witty elegance redolent of Cole Porter – the score is rich in melodic invention throughout. Delicious entertainment from beginning to end!”<br />
