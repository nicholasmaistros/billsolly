of THE SNOW QUEEN at THE TRIAD THEATRE</U></font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman" size="+2"> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE SNOW QUEEN has been doing so well at The 
Triad Theatre that it's being extended for four more weekends. At the end of the 
present run, next Sunday August 1, it will reopen two weeks later on August 15, 
and play four more Sundays at 12 noon until September 5th.<br> <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freely 
adapted from the famous story by Hans Christian Andersen, THE SNOW QUEEN, a one-act 
musical (for children and adults), was first seen in New York nine years ago, 
and was described by Dulcie Leimbach of The New York Times as "Solid quirky Andersen 
— Musical comedy loyal to the original story, with many riveting characters and 
much humor." Last Friday July 23rd in The New York Times Laurel Graeber described 
this first revival as "Hilarious – an icy summer treat!"<BR> </font></p><p><font face="Times New Roman" size="+2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
music and lyrics are by Bill Solly, who also wrote the book with Donald Ward. 
Together, they are best-known as the authors of THE GREAT AMERICAN BACKSTAGE MUSICAL 
and many other Off Broadway shows.</font></p><p><font face="Times New Roman" size="+2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
story of the SNOW QUEEN concerns a magic mirror which distorts everything it reflects, 
and what happens when the mirror gets smashed. Characters include Gerda and Kai, 
two children who play together in a rooftop garden of roses, until one of them 
is kidnapped and the other must set off on a lifetime of searching. Also there’s 
a mischievous old lady with a garden of talkative flowers, a pair of royal newlyweds, 
two wicked goblins, a gossipy raven, the disreputable inhabitants of a robbers’ 
castle, and the mysterious Snow Queen herself in her palace of ice. </font></p><p><font face="Times New Roman" size="+2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
cast of seven includes Katy Frame and Stephen Weston as Gerda and Kai, Nathan 
Anderson as the Goblin and the Raven, Rebecca Stavis as the Old Lady and the Little 
Robber Girl, Marc Tumminelli as the Narrator and the Prince, Rebecca Halpin as 
the Princess and three other characters (!), and Jessica Calvello as both theRose 
and the Snow Queen. </font></p><p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="+2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Costumes 
are by Alan Michael Smith, musical direction is by Barbara J. Anselmi, and the 
director is Igor Goldin. </FONT></p><p><font face="Times New Roman" size="+2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill

BEAUTY MUSICAL, THE STORY OF MILLICENT, two Christmas musicals and MOTHER GOOSE.</font></p><p><font face="Times New Roman" size="+2"><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE
